### Mood Tracker

- Vue
- Pinia for store
- Vitest for unit test

### How to start:

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`

### More can be improved:

- Text coverage (I only implemented the test for components)
- E2E test should be implemented using Cypress or Playwright, etc
- Better code structure for real projects
- Security like secure cookie, https, CSP, validation, XSS, authentication, etc.
